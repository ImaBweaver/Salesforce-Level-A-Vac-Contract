                 <b>PROCEDURES AND CONDITIONS –VACUUM EXCAVATION</b><br/><hr/>
                 <br/>
                 Master Locators provides vacuum excavation services with air to safely locate and expose underground utilities. <br/>
                 Vacuum excavation is a fast, non-destructive, cost effective and accurate process to safely locate underground utilities <br/>
                 when utility conflicts exist or when precise excavation within congested areas is required.  Master Locators also <br/>
                 performs vacuum excavation services to obtain Quality Level A utility information in accordance with ASCE 38-02 <br/>
                 Standard Guidelines for the Collection and Depiction of Existing Subsurface Utility Data. <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Master Locators uses air knife and vacuum excavation systems to dig eight (8) to twelve (12) inch diameter test holes <br/>
                 to expose underground utilities.  Test hole depths will depend upon the soil conditions and ground water table <br/>
                 elevations of the area to be excavated.  The number of test holes performed daily will also be dependent upon the soil <br/>
                 conditions and test hole depths required to reach the utility. <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Under certain circumstances and soil conditions, vacuum excavation services will become useless such as in rocky <br/>
                 soils or in soils with high water saturations.  Master Locators will immediately notify the client when these <br/>
                 circumstances exist.  Continued excavations in these conditions is at the sole discretion of the client.  Master Locators <br/>
                 makes no guarantees or warranties that utilities can be exposed in these conditions. <br/>
                 <br/>
                 All excavated soils are temporarily stored in the vacuum spoils tank and subsequently backfilled into the test hole and <br/>
                 compacted for proper temporary restoration.  When excavating test holes underneath asphalt or concrete surfaces (if <br/>
                 required), Master Locators will saw-cut a square hole.  Unless explicitly indicated, restoration of the asphalt or <br/>
                 concrete surfaces is not included within this quotation.   When excavating test holes underneath asphalt or concrete <br/>
                 surfaces, the number of test holes completed in a day will be reduced. <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Test hole locations will be coordinated with the client or staked in the field by the client prior to performing work. <br/>
                 Any utility designations that are required are not included with vacuum excavation services. <br/>
                 <br/>
                 For hydro excavations, a water source and dump site must be provided on-site by the client. <br/>
                 <br/>
                 For larger excavations, client is responsible to provide and install shoring and de-watering if necessary. <br/>
                 <br/>
                 <b>CONDITIONS</b><br/><hr/>
                 <br/>
                 ML will always stand behind its work and seeks to achieve quality through the uniformity and predictability of the <br/>
                 services we provide.  In the event that a quality issue occurs, ML requests notification within 24 hours.  We will send <br/>
                 a representative to the site within 24 hours of notice to review the work and investigate root cause. <br/>
